## Introduction
> Coyote optimization algorithm(COA) has shown effi cient performance by relying on a unique multiple
population mechanism. However, COA’s relatively homogeneous evolutionary scheme limits its
own comprehensive optimization performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a coyote optimization
algorithm based on optimization states(OSCOA), the OSCOA designs multiple schemes for diff erent
evolutionary processes of the population, which improves the comprehensive strength of the algo-
rithm. To avoid blind search, OSCOA introduces a mechanism to monitor the optimization state of
population, the mechanism helps the algorithm to select the evolutionary schemes suitable for the
current state to improve the effi ciency of the population search. To verify the effi ciency of the proposed
algorithm, the OSCOA and other excellent intelligent optimization algorithms are comprehensively
analyzed and tested on 59 benchmark functions including CEC2014 and CEC2107 benchmark suites.
And the experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of OSCOA. To further test
the ability of the OSCOA algorithm to solve in real-world problems, two applications including the
deployment of wireless sensor networks and the image segmentation are introduced, and the OSCOA
algorithm is successfully applied to these two real-world applications
